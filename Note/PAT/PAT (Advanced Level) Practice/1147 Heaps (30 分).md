# 题目详情
In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C. A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree. (Quoted from Wikipedia at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap\_(data\_structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)))

Your job is to ==tell if a given complete binary tree is a heap==.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives ==two positive integers: $M$ ($≤ 100$), the number of trees to be tested; and $N$ ($1 < N \le 1,000$), the number of keys in each tree==, respectively. Then $M$ lines follow, each contains $N$ distinct integer keys (all in the range of **int**), which gives ==the level order traversal sequence of a complete binary tree.==

### Output Specification:

For each given tree, ==print in a line `Max Heap` if it is a max heap, or `Min Heap` for a min heap, or `Not Heap` if it is not a heap at all. Then in the next line print the tree's postorder traversal sequence.== All the numbers are separated by a space, and there must no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

    3 8
    98 72 86 60 65 12 23 50
    8 38 25 58 52 82 70 60
    10 28 15 12 34 9 8 56


### Sample Output:

    Max Heap
    50 60 65 72 12 23 86 98
    Min Heap
    60 58 52 38 82 70 25 8
    Not Heap
    56 12 34 28 9 8 15 10
# 题解

遍历所有的结点，检查是否满足堆的性质。然后输出后序遍历，注意空格的处理。

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int m, n, arr[1005];

void postOrder(int root) {
    if (root * 2 <= n) {
        postOrder(root * 2);
        cout << " ";
    }
    if (root * 2 + 1 <= n) {
        postOrder(root * 2 + 1);
        cout << " ";
    }
    cout << arr[root];
}

int main() {
    cin >> m >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        bool maxH = true, minH = true;
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
            cin >> arr[j];
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (j * 2 <= n) {
                if (arr[j * 2] > arr[j])
                    maxH = false;
                else if (arr[j * 2] < arr[j])
                    minH = false;
            }
            if (j * 2 + 1 <= n) {
                if (arr[j * 2 + 1] > arr[j])
                    maxH = false;
                else if (arr[j * 2 + 1] < arr[j])
                    minH = false;
            }
        }

        if (maxH)
            cout << "Max Heap\n";
        else if (minH)
            cout << "Min Heap\n";
        else
            cout << "Not Heap\n";
        postOrder(1);
        cout << "\n";
    }
}
```
